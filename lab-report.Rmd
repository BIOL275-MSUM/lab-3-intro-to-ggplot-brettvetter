## Fireflies

> A. Insert an R code chunk and create a graph depicting the frequency distribution of the 35 mass measurements. It should have legible text and appropriate axis labels.

```{r}
# Fireflies --------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)


# Read data ---------------------------------------------------

firefly_data <- read_csv("https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/wp-content/data/chapter02/chap02q19FireflySpermatophoreMass.csv")

ggplot(data = firefly_data) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = spermatophoreMass), binwidth = .005,
                 
                 fill = "#C5351B", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Mass of spermatophore (mg)", y = "Frequency (number of Fireflies)") +
  
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "black", size = rel(1))
  )
```




> B. What type of graph did you choose in part (A)? Why?

\I chose to create a histogram because they are good for displaying the distribution of numerical data.


> C. Describe the shape of the frequency distribution. What are its main features?

\This histogram is unimodal skewing to the right. The main bell shaped area is around 0.04mg-0.10mg and there is an outlier around 0.16mg-0.17mg.

> D. What term would be used to describe the largest measurement in the frequency distribution? You can refer to the lecture slides, your notes, or the textbook.

## Bird orders

I read the data using the code provided by the instructor. The dataset is from the auk package and was originally named ebird_taxonomy. I converted it to a tibble, removed non-species taxa, and named the new dataset birds.

```{r}
library(auk)                          # load the auk package
birds <- ebird_taxonomy %>%           # start with the ebird_taxonomy data
  as_tibble() %>%                     # tibbles print better in the console
  filter(category == "species")       # remove non-species taxa
```

> E. How many bird species are in the new birds dataset? How did you find out?

\There are 10,721 bird species in this dataset. I found this by creating a table of distinct scientific names and there were a total of 10,721 rows, so that told me there is that many species.

> H. How many orders are there? You can get this right by counting on the graph, but you will only get full points if you use some code to figure it out.

\There are 41 orders. I found this by creating a contingency table for the same data of bird orders and their frequencies of species. There were 41 rows so that means that there are  41 different bird orders. 

> F. Insert an R code chunk and create a graph depicting the distribution of orders in the birds dataset. Sort the orders with the most frequent on the left. It should have legible text and appropriate axis labels.

```{r}
# Bird orders ------------------------------------------------

library(auk)                          # load the auk package
birds <- ebird_taxonomy %>%           # start with the ebird_taxonomy data
  as_tibble() %>%                     # tibbles print better in the console
  filter(category == "species")       # remove non-species taxa

# Bird Order Bar Graph

ggplot(data = ebird_taxonomy) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = fct_infreq(order)), fill = "#E2A76F", 
           width = .8) +
  labs(x = "Order", y = "Frequency (log number of bird species)", 
       title = "Number of bird species in each order") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "black", size = rel(.8)),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )
```




> G. What kind of graph did you create? Why?

I created a bar graph for this data because they are good for displaying categorical data and comparing groups.
